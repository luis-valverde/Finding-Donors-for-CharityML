# Finding Donors for CharityML

Trained and tested several supervised machine learning models on preprocessed census data. 
The goal is to build a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50.000, to identify likely donors for a fictional non-profit organisation.
Developed naive classifier to compare testing results and selected best model based on accuracy, 
F-beta score and efficiency metrics.
